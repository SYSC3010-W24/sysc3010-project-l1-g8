1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

I spent 6 hours working on the project this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Writing sections 5 and 7 of the draft detailed design document, 2 hours
   2. Designing the web appliction UI, 1 hour1
   3. Implementing the web GUI design into code, 3 hours

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- Design and code a (currently incomplete) website for FANS.
- Write sections 5 and 7 of the draft detailed design document for submission on FBF

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- Given the amount of time we have to develop FANS, I am a bit stressed that we are behind schedule. Writing 10+ page reports takes away time from actually devloping the project

- While fun, competing in the Candian Engineering Competition with another team mate took a considerable amount of development time away

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Finishing the design for the web GUI.
- Making sure the website can connect to the parts of FANS we have running (sensory data)
- Figuring out how to store data for the website using SQl and Firebase
Find better tutorials on how to use a smoke detector without an ADC, or order one really quickly

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- We need to receive all the sensory components for our project so we can  properly build and test the system.
- Missing an ADC for the smoke detector

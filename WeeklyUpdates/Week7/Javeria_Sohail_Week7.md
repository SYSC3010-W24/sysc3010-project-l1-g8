1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

I spent 6 hours working on the project this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Writing sections 1,2 and 4 of the draft detailed design document, 2 hours
   2. Implementing the buzzer PiCO code, 3 hours

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- Currently in progress of designing the PiCo code for the buzzer
- Write sections 1,2 and 4 draft detailed design document for submission on FBF

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- Given the amount of time we have for our demos, the reports take a lot of time from us and the feedback fruits takes an hour minimum as I try my best to give fruitful feedbacks which is making us lose time


5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Finishing the buzzer Pico implentation
- Making sure the hardwares are integrating just fine
- Figuring out how to implement the communication protocols and see if we can start testing when all the hardware arrives.
Find better tutorials on how to use a smoke detector without an ADC, or order one really quickly

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- We need to receive all the sensory components for our project so we can  properly build and test the system.
- Missing an ADC for the smoke detector

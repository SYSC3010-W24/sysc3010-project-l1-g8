1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

This week, I dedicated 5 hours to the project.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Drafting sections 1, 2, and 4 of the detailed design document: 3 hours
   2. Developing the email notification feature: 2 hours

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- Initiated the development of the email notification feature.
- Drafted sections 1, 2, and 4 of the detailed design document for the forthcoming submission.

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- The preparation of demos and reports is considerably time-consuming, with the process of providing detailed and constructive feedback alone taking upwards of an hour. This aspect has been particularly challenging in managing our time efficiently.

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Complete the email notification feature development.
- Ensure seamless integration of hardware components.
- Explore and implement communication protocols, and initiate testing as soon as all hardware components are received.

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- The project is currently hindered by the delayed arrival of essential sensory components, which are critical for building and testing the system.
- An ADC for the smoke detector is yet to be acquired.

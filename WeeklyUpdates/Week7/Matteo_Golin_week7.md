## Weekly Individual Project Update Report

### Group number: L1-G8

### Student name: Matteo Golin

### Week: 6 (28 Feb - 6 Mar)

---

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

I spent 9 hours this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Writing the project detailed design document: 4 hours
   2. Working on the sensor data collection software: 3 hours
   3. Working on the notification system software: 2 hours

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- Have a basis for uploading sensor data to the Firebase DB and triggering emergencies
- Have some IP addresses being uploaded to the Firebase DB in preparation for UDP communication
- Have a basis for modifying email templates and sending them out over email

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- Progress this week felt stressful. The design document took a lot of time away from actual development, especially
  with the upcoming communication demo
- Myself and one of my team members were competing in the Canadian Engineering Competition in Calgary this weekend, so
  we did not have an opportunity to contribute until we returned, which was more stressful
- Unfortunately, there was still much to be done when we returned

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Purchase an ADC for the smoke detector sensor because my team missed that requirement
- Have the full suite of UDP communication working between nodes
- Have some form of sensor data display on the UI

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- Saja and Javeria have not completed any boiler plate code for the nodes they are responsible for, which is blocking me
  from being able to work fully on the end-to-end communication test
- The ADC for the smoke detector sensor is missing, so I cannot attempt to do the smoke detector sensor data collection
  until then. Grant has suggested he found a tutorial that didn't use an ADC so that needs to be examined this week.

1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**

I spent 7 hours working on the project this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Updating section 5 of the final detailed design document with redesigns for the web GUI, 2 hours
   2. Redesigning the 4 pages of the web GUI in Figma, 2 hours
   3. Implementing the new web GUI design into code, 3 hours

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- I was able to redesign the team's website GUI based on FBF feedback from last week
- Did more research on components needed for the MQ2 sensor based on a team mates concerns about missing components
- Updated section 5 of the final detailed design report, as well as made general imrpovements to the report based on FBF feedback
- Emailed SCE services about getting an ADC for our project (will buy one if they don't have any)

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- Anxious. We are missing a component due to my oversight and were running out of time to get the part. We're also just running out of development time in general. With the speed at which things are moving, we may have to develop the physical project in a weekend.

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Buy or get an ADC
- Finish implementing web GUI, learn how to do user authentication with Flask
- Start building containers for the varying components of *FANS* 

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- Need components to start developing actual project.

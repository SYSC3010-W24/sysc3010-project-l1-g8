I spent 2 hours this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Researching sample code for the smoke detector sensor request on Digikey (1 hour)
   2. Writing sample code for acquiring and storing temperature data from the Sense Hat (1 hour)

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- Finalized component list for the component request form
- Determined how to fetch and store temperature data

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- Progress felt slow because of reading week, the week before was also slow because of many deadlines.
- I feel that I need to accomplish more this week to keep the project on track

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Post the temperature data officially in our Firebase DB
- Play with configurable warnings for the temperature threshold

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- I will need the smoke sensor to be purchased soon to finish working with the sensor data collection. This has to wait
  for the faculty.

I spent 14 hours on the project this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Completed the implementation of the Pico Haptic Alarm (5 hours)
   2. Worked on the draft final report (1 hour)
   3. Filmed final demo video with group members and on my own (4 hours)
   4. Added my updated PEP8 code on Github (2 hour)
   5. Created new schematics for my breadboard circuits and wrote installation instructions (2 hour)

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

   - Completed the implementation of the haptic alarm on Raspberry Pico
   - Worked on the draft final report 
   - Filmed final demo video with group members and on my own
   - Made my code conform to PEP8
   - Created new schematics for my breadboard circuits using Fritzing and wrote installation instructions
     
4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- This week had a very heavy workload, which was difficult to balance with other courses and the Feedback fruits takes so much time.
- I'm confident in our system's features now, although the UI may need a little more polishing before the lab demo.
- I am just concerned our video might not be of the best quality but I am pretty proud of my team.

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Complete the term reflection
- Get all final features solidified before the lab demo on Thursday
- Complete the final report
- Ensure that the code base conforms to proper standards and meets rubric expectations before submitting

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- I just want to see the final video and review it before it's submitted on Wednesday!

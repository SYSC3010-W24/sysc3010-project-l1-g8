I spent 18 hours on the project this week.

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)

   1. Completed the implementation of the smoke detector circuit (2 hours)
   2. Added charts to the web GUI and setting of thresholds (3 hours)
   3. Added timeout feature to the web GUI and the sensor collection system (2 hours)
   4. Worked on the draft final report (1 hour)
   5. Filmed final demo video with group members and on my own (6 hours)
   6. Added GitHub workflows to repository and made my code conform to PEP8 (2 hour)
   7. Created new schematics for my breadboard circuits and wrote installation instructions (1 hour)
   8. Attempted to create housing boxes for each Pi-based node (1 hour)

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

   - Completed the implementation of the smoke detector circuit to gather smoke concentration measurements
   - Added charts to the web GUI and setting of thresholds
   - Added timeout feature to the web GUI and the sensor collection system
   - Worked on the draft final report deployment diagram, contributions and reflections sections
   - Filmed final demo video with group members and on my own
   - Added GitHub workflows to repository for linting and formatting, and made my code conform to PEP8
   - Created new schematics for my breadboard circuits using KiCad and wrote installation instructions
   - Attempted to create housing boxes for each Pi-based node

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- This week had a very heavy workload, which was difficult to balance with other courses
- I'm confident in our system's features now, although the UI may need a little more polishing before the lab demo
- I'm concerned about the quality of the video recorded for the final demo reflections because we had so little time
  this weekend

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Complete the term reflection
- Get all final features solidified before the lab demo on Thursday
- Complete the final report
- Ensure that the code base conforms to proper standards and meets rubric expectations before submitting

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- I just want to see the final video and review it before it's submitted on Wednesday!

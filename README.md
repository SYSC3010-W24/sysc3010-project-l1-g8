# ðŸ”¥ FANS (Fire Alarm Notification System)

FANS is a comprehensive multi-system solution for fire-related emergencies that require prompt notification of persons
in the affected area.

FANS utilizes smoke and temperature sensors to accurately detect fires in its surrounding environment. Upon detection,
FANS issues SMS and email notifications to individuals in the surrounding area.

FANS provides a dashboard for live monitoring of its environment, as well as an interface for customizing things like
its sensitivity to pressure changes.

\section{Contributions}

This section lists all of the contributions of each member on the FANS development team.

\subsection{Code Contributions}

Code file contributions listed in this table will use Unix file paths to describe which files were worked on by each
contributor. The asterisk signifies the wildcard operator, so \texttt{alarm-system/*} captures all files within the
alarm-system/ directory. All paths correspond to paths within the project repository on GitHub.

For a more granular view of contributions for files with multiple authors, please review the Git commit history.

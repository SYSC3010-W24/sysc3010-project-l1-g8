\section{Problem Statement}

The need for the Fire Alarm Notification System (FANS) stems from the alarming number of preventable fire deaths in
Canada, where 220 people die in fires each year, with at least one in seven of these deaths occurring in homes without
working smoke alarms \cite{fire-stats}. This critical problem underscores the shortcomings of traditional fire alarm
systems, which often lack advanced communication capabilities and real-time monitoring capabilities
\cite{modern-fire-alarms}. These limitations not only contribute to delayed response times, but also to preventable
deaths, underscoring the urgent need for an advanced fire alarm solution.

Traditional systems' shortcomings, coupled with the fact that smoke detection systems are sometimes unsafely disarmed
by users to avoid false alarms—especially those installed close to kitchen spaces—further exacerbate the problem. The
FANS project seeks to address these issues by integrating smoke and temperature sensors with Internet of Things (IoT)
technology. This approach not only aims to cover scenarios where smoke may not reach the detecting device but also
offers real-time notifications via SMS and email, thus notifying homeowners immediately in the event of an emergency.

By providing configurable thresholds for smoke and temperature alarms and adjustable timeouts that prevent the system
from being deactivated in an unsafe manner, FANS aims to use technological advances to significantly improve the
effectiveness of fire detection systems. The ultimate goal of the project is to reduce response times, improve overall
fire safety and thereby mitigate fire disasters and protect the well-being of individuals, families and communities
across Canada \cite{smoke-alarm-gc}.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accurate and Reliable Detection} \\ Implement dual-sensor technology combining photoelectric and thermistor-based
          sensors for accurate smoke and temperature detection, alongside self-testing routines to ensure reliability.

    \item \textbf{Real-time Monitoring and Alerts} \\ Utilize a cloud-based platform for continuous real-time data analysis, with a
          reliable communication channel for immediate alert dispatch.

    \item \textbf{User-configurable Settings} \\ Provide an intuitive interface for users to customize alarm thresholds and notification
          preferences, including quiet hours and primary notification channels.

    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Notification System} \\ Initiate on-site alarms and send email to users and designated contacts to ensure
          widespread awareness during emergencies.

    \item \textbf{Integration with Emergency Services} \\ Facilitate automatic emergency service alerts upon fire detection, including
          crucial details like location and building type, to expedite response times.

          % TODO: REPLACE
\end{enumerate}

By adopting these key requirements, FANS aims to deliver a technologically advanced, user-friendly system for timely
fire detection and response, aiming to reduce fire-related fatalities and enhance safety for individuals and
communities across Canada.

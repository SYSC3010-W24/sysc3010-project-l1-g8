\section{Project Update}

FANS development is going well despite being slightly behind schedule. The team has a prototype design for a GUI,
multiple diagrams on the systems interactions, and code for some sensory data (temperature). The milestones the team
set are achievable, but we are bound to meet some roadblocks given the amount of work and reports we need to write
outside of developing the system. Time management will be an asset in this project.

Each team member's assigned workload is manageable, and development will pick up once we have access to components
needed for FANS. The only changes to the initial plan will be further extending the time needed to reach each of our
objectives (the objectives themselves are still achievable).

\subsection{Project Milestones}

FANS will continue to be built gradually over the course of the semester, adding new components and interactivity over
time. To better match the teamâ€™s workflow and pace, we decided to extend the deadlines for our milestones. By moving
each date up by 1 week, we give ourselves more time to complete the system while staying on schedule.
